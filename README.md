# MiniMicro-AutoSafe
An autosafe system that backups all you MiniScript files every time you run your project

# How to use
Import `AutoSafe.ms` only in the main file, and only once.
That's it, when you execute your project it will automatically copy all your MiniScript files into `backups/ID`, where ID is a number, the larger the number, the more recent the backup is
